Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are information processing systems that are
modeled on and inspired by the human brain, which they try to mimic by learning
how to recognize patterns in data. They accomplish tasks by having a well structured
architecture. This architecture is composed of several small processing units called
neurons, which are interconnected in order to solve major problems.
